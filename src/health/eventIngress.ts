/**
 * PURPOSE: The one deliberate authenticated ingress boundary approved by
 * issue #347/#351 — accepts a single bounded Farstax health/operations
 * scenario (a health plugin report crossing into `red` status) and starts
 * bounded work through the ordinary owning Run (bridge_runs), executed by
 * the SAME provider-turn execution owner ordinary Telegram-driven turns use
 * (BridgeEngine.executeSurfaceNeutralTurn), with no preceding chat turn. Not a
 * general event bus: only this one event kind is accepted, and
 * authorization comes solely from the authenticated `token`, never from
 * event payload content.
 *
 * Architecture (per the corrected #351 issue body):
 *   external health event
 *     -> authenticated/idempotent durable receipt   (acceptHealthOpsEvent)
 *     -> ordinary owning Run                         (bridge_runs)
 *     -> main agent + AGENTS.md + Skill + tools       (executeHealthOpsRun)
 *     -> terminal Run/result                          (BridgeEngine.executeSurfaceNeutralTurn + EventStore)
 *     -> receipt correlation                          (reconcileEventReceiptResult)
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT create a work_item/work_job/ops_check job (that was
 * the original, superseded design that recreated the mechanical Worker
 * workflow layer issue #347 removes) and deliberately does NOT reimplement
 * CLI invocation via buildCliInvocation/runCli directly. Instead
 * executeHealthOpsRun calls the engine's surface-neutral wrapper. That
 * wrapper keeps the ordinary provider-attempt owner plus its outer lock
 * heartbeat and continuation lifecycle.
 *
 * The wrapper requires a numeric sentinel chat id, a synthetic chat key, an
 * execution-lane handle, and the existing BridgeEvent collector. Those are
 * data needed by the provider runtime and EventStore. They do not create a
 * Telegram delivery or conversation session.
 *
 * NEIGHBORS: src/db.ts, src/repositories/eventReceiptRepository.ts,
 * src/engine.ts, src/events/store.ts, src/health/scheduler.ts
