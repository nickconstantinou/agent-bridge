# Guarded manual clearing tool for the interrupted-rollout sentinel
# (Phase 4C.4, issue #135). Install root-owned at:
#   /usr/local/sbin/rollout-sentinel-clear
# Reads the same root-owned inventory as rollout-agent-bridge.sh:
#   /etc/agent-bridge/rollout.conf
#
# Clearing the sentinel is never a bare `rm`. This tool acquires the exact
# same exclusive rollout lock rollout-agent-bridge.sh uses, before reading
# or deleting anything — if the lock cannot be acquired (a rollout is
# genuinely in progress), it aborts immediately and leaves the sentinel
# completely untouched, never falling back to an unguarded read or delete.
# Only once the lock is held does it re-validate the sentinel's ownership/
# mode/non-symlink status and cross-check its recorded expected_commit and
# artifact_dir against what the operator supplies on the command line —
# proving the operator has actually reviewed the evidence for *this*
# sentinel, not a stale one from an unrelated earlier attempt — before
# logging the action and removing it.
