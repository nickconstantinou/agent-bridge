# Architecture lint guard (Epic 11, issue #52).
# Fails when production code under src/ imports or calls test-only APIs.
# General raw SQLite boundary enforcement is intentionally deferred (see
# issue #52); the advisor_calls/advisor_attempts and
# conversation_turns/conversation_summaries tables are a narrow, Phase 4B
# exception (see issue #135) — their SQL is confined to the repository files
# that own them, plus the legacy baseline migration that creates them and one
# explicitly marked non-schema maintenance statement in src/db.ts.

# tables must only be referenced from their owning repository, the legacy
# baseline migration (which creates them), or a statement whose immediately
# preceding comment block carries an explicit `arch-lint-allow-legacy-sql`
# marker. Delegated to a Node script (scripts/sqlOwnershipLint.mjs) because
# binding a marker to exactly one statement — not a fixed line window that
# could let a nearby unmarked statement slip through — needs real per-line
