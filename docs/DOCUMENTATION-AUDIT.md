# Documentation Conformance Audit

Validated against: `main` at `23d06cfc3e098561ec21ce29880e60d1d146b7cc`.

Scope: documents under `docs/`, plus code and root documentation needed to determine runtime references.

## Method

This audit classifies each reviewed document by comparing it with current implementation touchpoints and the current architecture hierarchy.

Primary grounding files checked:

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `package.json`
- `src/index.ts`
- `src/index-health.ts`
- `src/cli.ts`
- `src/soul.ts`
- `src/messageDelivery.ts`
- `src/nativeLayout.ts`
- `src/events/*` references from architecture docs
- worker files referenced by `docs/WORKER-GUIDE.md` and architecture docs

Operational note: the chat GitHub connector can fetch files and mutate branches, but repository-wide traversal was not reliable in this environment. The local runtime also could not clone GitHub because outbound DNS failed. This audit therefore uses direct file reads for the known docs set and code-grounding files. Treat it as a conservative conformance baseline and run `find docs -type f | sort` in a local checkout before large-scale file moves.

## Executive findings

1. The repository already has the right documentation hierarchy: ADRs, architecture, roadmap, research, and archive.
2. The missing piece was a docs landing page that tells humans and coding agents which documents are authoritative.
3. `docs/soul.md` must not be archived as “just research.” It documents implemented runtime behavior, although runtime loading defaults to root `SOUL.md`, not `docs/soul.md`.
4. Several root research files are now implementation records or superseded pointers. They should not drive new work.
5. `docs/native-telegram-layout-spike.md` needs a follow-up status refresh because it says rich-message paths were retired, while production code still attempts `sendRichMessage` for table routes when available.
6. `docs/prompt-optimization-loop-research.md` remains useful because `AGENTS.md` points to it, but its earlier `src/agentMemory.ts` discussion is stale.

## Runtime dependency notes

### `docs/soul.md`

The design is implemented, but the runtime asset is not `docs/soul.md` by default.

Current behavior:

- `src/soul.ts` defaults to `<projectDir>/SOUL.md`.
- `AGENT_BRIDGE_SOUL_PATH` overrides the path.
- `AGENT_BRIDGE_SOUL_MODE` controls `summary`, `full`, or `off`.
- `src/index.ts` loads the context and passes it to each companion engine.
- `src/index-health.ts` also loads the same context for health suggestions.
- `src/cli.ts` renders the soul contract into the prompt wrapper for Codex, Claude, Antigravity, and Kimchi paths.

Recommendation: keep `docs/soul.md` as runtime design documentation and ensure a root `SOUL.md` exists when persona injection is desired.

### Worker docs

`docs/WORKER-GUIDE.md` is authoritative for operator behavior. Architecture docs define boundaries, but the worker guide owns commands, configuration, and troubleshooting.

### Research docs

Root research files should not be implementation sources unless promoted. Most can move under `docs/research/` in a future mechanical cleanup once inbound references are updated.

## Recommended next cleanup PRs

1. Add front matter to all significant docs using the taxonomy in `docs/README.md`.
2. Refresh `docs/native-telegram-layout-spike.md` status to reflect current rich-message/table behavior.
3. Refresh `docs/soul.md` language from proposed to implemented runtime design.
4. Move completed implementation records into a dedicated location such as `docs/implementation-records/` or `docs/research/implemented/` after references are updated.
5. Move rejected/deferred root research files under `docs/research/` after references are updated.
6. Archive superseded pointer files once `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and any external operator references stop linking to their root paths.

## Guardrail for future agents

Before modifying documentation structure, agents must:

1. Inventory `docs/` from a real checkout.
2. Search for each filename across code, tests, root docs, systemd files, and scripts.
3. Classify runtime dependencies separately from research/roadmap status.
4. Preserve root pointer files when inbound references exist.
5. Avoid moving runtime-design docs such as `docs/soul.md` without checking implementation code first.
