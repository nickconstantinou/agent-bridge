# Persistent memory

Bridge-spawned agents receive `AGENT_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_COMMAND` when shared
project memory is available.

Before making architectural decisions or modifying important behaviour, use:

```bash
"$AGENT_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_COMMAND" --memory-query "<short relevant query>"
```

When you learn a durable project fact, decision, bug fix, convention, or
recurring issue, write a guarded candidate with:

```bash
"$AGENT_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_COMMAND" --memory-add-json '{"type":"decision","scope":"project","text":"<concise memory>","confidence":0.8}'
```

Do not save secrets, API keys, passwords, transient logs, or private personal
information.
