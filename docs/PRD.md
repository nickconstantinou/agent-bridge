# Agent-Bridge PRD: CLI Bridge Control Plane

## 1. Concept & Vision

**What it does:** Bridges Telegram and Discord messages to CLI-based AI coding agents (Codex, Antigravity/Gemini CLI, Claude Code), enabling real-time conversational coding, switchable interactive routing, health reporting, and policy-gated background engineering jobs.

**Core experience:** A user sends a prompt via Telegram or Discord → the bridge spawns the selected CLI agent → responses stream back through the same chat surface. Long-running worker jobs use Telegram commands and inline approvals to scan, plan, implement, open PRs, watch CI, and ask for merge decisions.

**What makes it different:** It's a thin, reliable bridge — not an agent itself. It handles chat transport, rate limiting, message batching, session management, process lifecycle, queue leases, and approval gates so the CLI agent can focus on reasoning and implementation.

---

## 2. Architecture

Product framing (ADR-008, `docs/architecture/03-target-architecture.md`): the
conversational surfaces below form the **Companion Runtime**, the worker bot is
the **Engineering Worker**, and both consume the **Shared Runtime** (SQLite,
event store, memory, provider adapters, CLI management). No service or env var
renames accompany this framing.

## 4. Features

### 4.1 Message Delivery

`sendMessageWithProgress` sends a typing indicator while the CLI runs, then sends the final response via `sendTelegramMessage`. If `/stop` was called during execution, `isAborted()` returns true and the final send is suppressed to prevent double-messages.

### 4.2 Session Persistence

| Bot | Resume flag |
|-----|-------------|
| Codex | `exec resume <sessionId>` |
| Antigravity | `--resume <sessionId>` |
| Claude | `--resume <sessionId>` |

Sessions are stored per chat in SQLite and restored across service restarts. Every user and assistant turn is also persisted to `conversation_turns`, surviving restarts and CLI switches. `/reset` clears the CLI session **and** all conversation turns + summaries for the chat.

### 4.3 Process Registry & Kill Switch

`runCli` and `runCliAsync` register each child process in `activeProcesses: Map<chatId, ChildProcess>`. Abort sends SIGTERM, escalates to SIGKILL after the grace period, and retains the process registration and execution lane until the close/error lifecycle confirms exit.

`/stop`, `/cancel`, and `/reset` retain the lane through the existing supervisor's confirmed close/error lifecycle. TERM-resistant children are escalated to SIGKILL before replacement work may start.

### 4.4 Conversation Persistence & Compaction

Every user message and assistant response is persisted to SQLite in `conversation_turns`. The table survives service restarts and CLI switches — replacing the previous in-memory `recentTurns` / `chatTurns` Maps.

`buildConvContext(chatKey, maxChars)` composes the latest compact summary (if any) plus recent raw turns into a context preamble prepended to CLI prompts. It fetches the newest `BRIDGE_CONTEXT_RECENT_TURN_LIMIT` turns after the summary (default 200; the *newest* N, not the first N — a chat with more un-compacted turns than this candidate cap never silently drops its most recent messages), then walks them newest-first, accumulating character count, and stops when the char budget is exhausted. The summary always takes priority and is included even if it alone exceeds the budget. Default budget: `BRIDGE_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS = 8_000` (~2K tokens); override via env var. This prompt-context cap is independent of compaction — `getConvTurnsForCompaction` always processes the full un-compacted backlog regardless of either limit.

**Context injection policy (`BRIDGE_CONTEXT_INJECTION_POLICY`):** `BridgeEngine._shouldInjectContext(chatKey, sessionId)` decides whether the recent-turn preamble and the `[Agent Bridge context]` usage-instructions block are injected for a given turn. `always` (default) injects on every turn, matching the behavior above unconditionally — no change for existing self-hosted deployments. `handoff_once` injects only when: there is no native CLI session for this chat+CLI (`sessionId == null`, which covers the first-ever turn, `/compact` resetting the session, and invalid-session retry recursing with a null session), or `handoffState.isHandoffRequired()` is true for this chat+CLI (set by manual `/cli` switch or capacity fallback, see `applyManualCliSwitchHandoff`/`prepareCliHandoff` in `src/interactiveBot.ts`). `/reset`'s `ctx_suppress` flag always wins over both. The handoff flag is consumed (cleared, logged) only on the turn that actually receives injected context — never on a turn the policy or `ctx_suppress` suppresses. The `AGENT_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_COMMAND`/`AGENT_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_DB`/`AGENT_BRIDGE_CHAT_KEY`/`AGENT_BRIDGE_CLI_KIND` env vars are set regardless of policy or injection decision — only the prompt text is gated. Recommended for platform-managed workspaces (`docs/architecture/platform-boundary.md`); default is unchanged for OSS.

**`/compact`** — Creates a semantic checkpoint and starts a fresh CLI session, via the shared `compactConversation()` service (`src/compactConversation.ts`):
1. Loads all un-compacted turns for the chat key via `getConvTurnsForCompaction` (`id > latest_summary.range_end_turn_id`).
2. Sends an immediate `Compacting context...` acknowledgement, records `compact_in_progress:<chatKey>` in `settings`, and logs compact lifecycle events.
3. Chunks the loaded turns by prompt budget (`COMPACT_CHUNK_MAX_CHARS = 16_000`, override with `BRIDGE_COMPACT_CHUNK_MAX_CHARS`).
4. Summarises each chunk with `buildCompactSummaryPrompt` (profile-aware: `engineering` or `companion`) in single-shot print mode (`sessionId: null`) with a 60s `Promise.race` timeout. Each call requests a single JSON object `{ summary_md, memory_candidates }`, parsed by `parseCompactOutput`, and runs tool-free through verified Codex, Claude, or Agy flags. Kimchi compaction fails closed without spawning until Kimchi has a verified tool-free execution mode. Chunk summaries run with bounded parallelism (`COMPACT_PARALLELISM = 2`, override with `BRIDGE_COMPACT_PARALLELISM`, max 8).
5. If multiple chunks or a previous summary exists, reduce-merges the previous compact summary plus chunk summaries into one durable `summary_md`.
6. **Non-destructive failure:** if any summariser call fails, times out, or returns output that isn't valid `{ summary_md, memory_candidates }` JSON, compaction stops there — no summary is stored and no turns are pruned. The previous summary and raw turns remain exactly as they were, and the user is told compaction failed so the conversation can continue uninterrupted.
7. On success, stores the final summary via `addConvSummary`, promotes `memory_candidates` through `storeProjectMemoryCandidate()` into `project_memories`, then prunes raw turns up to `endId` via `pruneConvTurns`.
8. Clears the `compact_in_progress` / `ctx_suppress` flags and the CLI session — next prompt starts a fresh CLI seeded with the new summary.

**`/context`** — Reports current conversation state: turn count, pending queue depth, last turn timestamp, last compact time, and any active `compact_in_progress:<chatKey>` marker. Reads from `getConvStatus` and `getLatestConvSummary`. If stored turns exceed 100, it appends `High turn count - consider /compact`.

**`/reset`** — Preserves conversation data but suppresses context injection. Sets a `ctx_suppress:<chatKey>` flag in the `settings` table and clears the CLI session. The next prompt starts a fresh CLI with no history preamble. The `ctx_suppress` flag is automatically cleared when `/compact` runs.

### 4.4a Model Fallback

On `MODEL_CAPACITY_EXHAUSTED` / `No capacity available` / `rateLimitExceeded`, the bridge retries with the next model in the preference chain. Configured via `CODEX_MODEL_PREFERENCE` / `ANTIGRAVITY_MODEL_PREFERENCE` / `CLAUDE_MODEL_PREFERENCE` (comma-separated, priority order):

**Codex**:
```
gpt-5.6-luna → gpt-5.6-sol → gpt-5.6-terra → gpt-5.5 → gpt-5.4 → gpt-5.4-mini → (give up)
```

**Antigravity**:
```
gemini-3.5-flash-high → gemini-3.5-flash-medium → gemini-3.1-pro-high → gemini-3.1-pro-low → (give up)
```

**Claude**:
```
claude-sonnet-4-6 → claude-opus-4-7 → (give up)
```

The response is prepended with a warning notice when a fallback is used.

> **Antigravity note**: Agy does not accept a `--model` CLI flag. Model selection (including fallback) is applied by mapping the chosen model ID (e.g. `gemini-3.5-flash-high`) to its display label (e.g. `Gemini 3.5 Flash (High)`) and writing that value into `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` before the process is spawned. Resetting to default removes the `model` key so Agy falls back to its own default.

### 4.4b Agent Context and Advisor Helpers

CLI agents spawned by the bridge receive three environment variables injected by `buildCliInvocation`:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `AGENT_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_AVAILABLE` | `"1"` — signals helper is present |
| `AGENT_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_COMMAND` | Absolute path to `bin/agent-bridge-context` |
| `AGENT_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_DB` | DB path for the current bot instance |
| `AGENT_BRIDGE_CHAT_KEY` | Current chat key (`chatId:threadId`) |
| `AGENT_BRIDGE_CLI_KIND` | Current CLI kind (`codex`, `claude`, or `antigravity`) |
| `AGENT_BRIDGE_REPO_PATH` | Workspace path for memory provenance |
| `AGENT_BRIDGE_ADVISOR_COMMAND` | Absolute path to `bin/agent-bridge-advisor` |
| `AGENT_BRIDGE_ADVISOR_CAPABILITY` | Opaque, expiring capability bound by the broker to the active scope and turn |

The `agent-bridge-context` binary (in `bin/`) opens the DB read-only for
inspection commands and outputs:
- `agent-bridge-context` (no args) — latest compact summary
- `agent-bridge-context --recent [N]` — N most recent turns (default 20, max 100)
- `agent-bridge-context --memory` — conversation-aware project memory matches
- `agent-bridge-context --memory-query "<query>"` — explicit project memory query

For agent-driven writes, the helper also supports:
- `agent-bridge-context --memory-add-json '<json>'` — stores a validated project
  memory candidate with chat, CLI, latest-turn, repo, and confidence provenance

When `BRIDGE_ADVISOR_ENABLED=true`, agents are prompted to request a bounded
second opinion with:

```bash
"$AGENT_BRIDGE_ADVISOR_COMMAND" --mode review --task "<question>"
```

The advisor helper supports `plan`, `review`, `debug`, `risk`, and `decision`.
It submits only capability, mode, and task over a user-owned Unix socket. The
running bridge owns configuration, scope, database, budgets, provider chain,
executables, and audit writes. Agent-direct provider children have advisor
environment removed and must support technical tool disabling; currently that
means Claude with `--tools ""`. Disabled, invalid, or unsupported chains are
not advertised. The advisor cannot execute or approve.

Agents may also emit a hidden post-turn sidecar in the successful response:

```html
<!-- agent-bridge-memory
[{ "type": "decision", "scope": "project", "text": "Durable project fact." }]
-->
```

The engine strips `agent-bridge-memory` sidecars before Telegram delivery,
conversation persistence, and `onAfterExecute` hooks, then stores valid
candidates. `--memory-add-json` and sidecars both reject invalid type/scope,
duplicate text, transient text, secret-looking values, empty text, and oversized
text. This gives CLI agents queryable access to bridge conversation history and
shared project memory without any MCP server. The bridge prompt preamble tells
agents when `AGENT_BRIDGE_CONTEXT_AVAILABLE=1` and how to invoke it.

`/compact` is the single automatic durable-memory distillation path. It
produces both a conversation summary and validated memory candidates in one
step; the former post-turn extractor (`BRIDGE_MEMORY_EXTRACTOR_ENABLED`),
which ran a bounded JSON-only extraction call after every successful agent
reply, has been removed in favor of this deliberate compaction point. See
`docs/architecture/memory-and-handoff.md` for the current design.

Project memories live in `project_memories` with an FTS5 index. Retrieval
normalizes punctuation, hyphens, simple plural/singular variants, and bridge
vocabulary synonyms such as compact/summary, fallback/switch/promotion, and
context/history.

### 4.5 Interactive Bot CLI-to-CLI Fallback

In the unified interactive bot (switchable CLI), if all model fallbacks of the user's preferred CLI are exhausted and the bot encounters a capacity/rate-limit error (e.g. `session limit` or `resets`), `dispatchInteractiveWithFallback` (`src/interactiveBot.ts`) automatically:
1. Compacts the database-owned conversation through the incoming healthy CLI before switching. The exhausted outgoing CLI is always excluded. Optional ordered `provider[:model]` targets in `BRIDGE_COMPACTION_CHAIN` are deduplicated and tried only for eligible bounded failures, after one schema-only structured-output repair. `BRIDGE_COMPACTION_MAX_ATTEMPTS` defaults to 3 (maximum 8), and `BRIDGE_COMPACTION_REPAIR_ATTEMPTS` defaults to 1 (maximum 1). Cancellation and fatal configuration/programming failures do not fall back. The step is rate-limited by `fallbackCompactCooldown.ts` (default 5 min, override `BRIDGE_FALLBACK_COMPACT_COOLDOWN_MS`). Compaction failure never blocks the fallback.
2. Clears the target CLI's own stored session (`db.setSession(chatKey, targetCli, null)`) and marks a one-time handoff flag for it (`src/handoffState.ts`) — so the target starts fresh rather than resuming a possibly stale, long-abandoned native session.
3. Advances to the next CLI in the preference chain (default order: `codex` → `claude` → `antigravity`, configurable via `INTERACTIVE_CLI_CHAIN` in environment variables), notifies the user, updates the Telegram commands menu, and replays the same update into the new CLI engine.
4. The engine's `_buildRecentContextPrompt` (unchanged from normal-turn behavior) injects the latest compact summary + recent turns on this turn as on every turn; the handoff flag is consumed (cleared, logged) at that point but does not currently gate injection — see `docs/architecture/companion-runtime.md` for the deferred first-turn-only optimization.
5. After a fallback CLI successfully completes the turn, promotes that CLI into the user's SQLite preference (`interactive_cli_preference` column in `bridge_state`) so the next message starts there instead of repeatedly retrying the exhausted CLI. If every CLI is exhausted, the stored preference is left unchanged.

Manual `/cli` switching applies the same target-session-clear + handoff-mark (`applyManualCliSwitchHandoff`), without the compact step (compaction is fallback-only, since manual switches are user-initiated and infrequent).

### 4.6 Concurrency Lock & Message Queue

`db.tryLock(surface, chatKey)` atomically inserts into `execution_locks`, whose primary key is `(surface, chat_key)`. A conversation scope is `chatId:threadId` whenever Telegram supplies a thread ID, including private-chat topics. Standalone bots use distinct surfaces; all providers behind one interactive bot share its surface. Lock heartbeat, result commit, and release compare the unique acquiring `run_id`.

If a lane is busy, the incoming message is queued to `pending_messages` under the same explicit `(surface, chat_key)` ownership (max `MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH = 5`), surviving restarts. One transactional admission operation either acquires an empty lane for the current message or appends it and claims the oldest durable row. Legacy rows created before the surface migration are retained under the quarantined `legacy` surface and cannot drain into a live bot. Handoff retains the lane while the interactive router resolves the current provider, and deletes the row only after a committed outcome plus a same-run lock fence. Fenced and failed rows remain recoverable. Startup scans live-surface queues; handler failures receive three bounded retries. Lock release occurs transactionally only when the lane queue is empty, preventing new arrivals from overtaking FIFO work.

Each service has a configuration-independent `service_id` and each process generation gets a unique `run_id`. Opening a second process never clears live locks. Engines renew their bounded lease while executing; a competing run may atomically take over only after `lease_expires_at`, proving the prior lock stale. The standalone service ID remains `telegram:standalone` when its enabled provider set changes.

Parsed results commit session, failure counter, memory sidecars, and conversation turns in one transaction that first renews the acquiring run's lease. Hooks, generated-file upload, compaction session reset, and final response delivery each require another successful renewal. A displaced run reports a fenced outcome and cannot delete its claimed queue row.

### 4.7 Rate Limit Handling

`TelegramClient.call()` retries automatically on HTTP 429 up to 2 times, sleeping `retry_after` seconds between attempts.

### 4.8 MediaGroup Batching

Photos sent as an album share a `media_group_id`. `MediaGroupBuffer` collects messages for 1500ms, then flushes them as a single `handleMessages` call so the agent sees the full context.

## 6. Data Model

### BridgeConfig

```typescript
interface BridgeConfig {
  allowedUserIds: ReadonlySet<string>;
  serviceEnvFile: string | null;
  serviceKind: "codex" | "antigravity" | "claude" | null;
  pollIntervalMs: number;
  executionMode: "safe" | "trusted";
  cliTimeoutMs: number;
  asyncEnabled: boolean;
  dbPath: string;
  bots: {
    codex: BotConfig;
    antigravity: BotConfig;
    claude: BotConfig;
  };
}
```

### SQLite Schema

**`bridge_state`** — settings and sessions. `active_execution_lock` remains as a legacy compatibility column and is not used for execution ownership.

**`execution_locks`** — surface- and conversation-scoped execution ownership:

```sql
CREATE TABLE execution_locks (
  surface TEXT NOT NULL,
  chat_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  service_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  run_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  acquired_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  lease_expires_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (surface, chat_key)
);
```

| Key pattern | Value | Purpose |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| `session:<chatId>:<bot>` | session ID | CLI session per chat |
| `$polling:<bot>` | last update_id | Telegram polling offset |
| `<bot>` | model name | Per-bot model override |

**`conversation_turns`** — persistent per-chat message history:

```sql
CREATE TABLE conversation_turns (
  id      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  chat_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  role    TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('user','assistant')),
  text    TEXT NOT NULL,
  cli     TEXT,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**`pending_messages`** — durable queue for messages that arrive while a lock is held:

```sql
CREATE TABLE pending_messages (
  id       INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  surface  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'legacy',
  chat_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  prompt   TEXT NOT NULL,
  chat_id  INTEGER NOT NULL,
  thread_id INTEGER,
  chat_type TEXT,
  user_id  INTEGER,
  state    TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'queued',
  claim_run_id TEXT,
  claimed_at TEXT,
  attachments_json TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**`conversation_summaries`** — LLM-generated compact checkpoints written by `/compact`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE conversation_summaries (
  id               INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  chat_key         TEXT NOT NULL,
  range_start_turn_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  range_end_turn_id   INTEGER NOT NULL,
  summary_md       TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

> Note: `conversation_turns` are pruned after `/compact` only after a final summary is successfully stored for the exact loaded range (rows up to `range_end_turn_id` deleted). Compaction failure prunes nothing. Startup also performs the same summary-gated cleanup for any already-summarized turns left behind by an interrupted process. Unsummarized turns are never TTL-deleted. `conversation_summaries` are small and kept indefinitely.

## 8. Security Model

### Authorization

`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` — comma-separated list of Telegram user IDs permitted to trigger executions. All other senders are silently ignored. The legacy single-value `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_ID` is accepted as a fallback.

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Codex flag | Antigravity flag | Claude flag |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| `safe` | (none) | (none) | (none) |
| `trusted` | `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` | `--yolo` | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` |

---

## 9. Deployment

### Systemd

Systemd units live in `systemd/`. Dedicated Telegram CLI bots share
`tsx src/index.ts`; the unified interactive bot uses `src/index-interactive.ts`;
the worker bot uses `src/index-worker.ts`; health uses `src/index-health.ts`;
Discord uses `src/index-discord-interactive.ts`.
Each service loads its own `/etc/default/agent-bridge-*` file and `NODE_BIN`
must point at Node 24+.

The installer (`scripts/install.sh`) requires Node 24+, generates local env
files from the `.env.*.example` templates, writes machine-specific values
(home dir, Node binary path, CLI binary paths, tokens) to service defaults, and
installs the standard services whose tokens/default files are present. Existing
deployments can be refreshed with `scripts/upgrade.sh`, which also
requires Node 24+ and updates `NODE_BIN` in `/etc/default/agent-bridge-*`.

The interactive Telegram bot and worker bot are operator-enabled services:
create `/etc/default/agent-bridge-interactive` or
`/etc/default/agent-bridge-worker-bot` from their examples before enabling
those units.

Worker implementation jobs support resumable checkpoints. `orchestrated_task`
stores `planning`, `executing`, and `verifying` progress in `work_jobs.phase`
and `phase_data_json`; after verification passes it queues `pr_lifecycle` so
branch push, draft PR creation, proof comments, and merge approval stay behind
the existing human gate.

The worker separates CLI routing by risk. Code-writing jobs use
`WORKER_CODE_CLI_CHAIN` (`codex,claude` by default, with `antigravity` stripped
if configured). Scribe/read-only jobs use `WORKER_SCRIBE_CLI_CHAIN`
(`antigravity,codex,claude` by default) for defect scans, feature plans, and
operator prose so Agy can save coding-model capacity without mutating
production code.

### Database

Each service instance has its own `DB_PATH` to avoid SQLite lock contention.

```
.data-codex/bridge.sqlite
.data-antigravity/bridge.sqlite
.data-claude/bridge.sqlite
.data/interactive.sqlite
.data/worker.sqlite
.data/discord.sqlite
.data/discord-interactive.sqlite
```

WAL mode is enabled on open for concurrent read access.

Discord interactive sessions use one row per Discord channel/thread alias. The
runtime receives real Discord channel snowflakes, creates deterministic numeric
aliases for the shared engine, and rewrites outbound sends back to the original
snowflake. General channels, DMs, and Discord thread channels therefore remain
isolated from each other while sharing the same CLI backend code.

## 10. Error Handling

| Error | Handling |
|-------|----------|
| CLI hard timeout | Kill process, error edit on placeholder |
| CLI abort (`/stop`) | SIGKILL, resolve cleanly, bridge continues |
| CLI capacity exhausted | Retry with fallback model from `*_MODEL_PREFERENCE`, prepend warning |
| Telegram 429 | Auto-retry up to 2 times with `retry_after` delay |
| "Message is not modified" | No-op (not a real error) |
| Execution lock held | Reply "⏳ System is currently busy" |
| Parse error | Return raw stdout as text |
| Agy execution error | Scans `--log-file` for errors (e.g. `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`), throws JSON payload to trigger fallback, and de-duplicates colon-separated segments |

---

## 11. Known Limitations

- CLI sessions are provider thread IDs — bridge conversation history (turns/summaries) is separate and bridge-owned
- `conversation_turns` are pruned post-compact and at startup only when already covered by `conversation_summaries`; unsummarized history is retained
- Sync path (`BRIDGE_ASYNC_ENABLED=false`) available but not the default
- `abortCliProcess` SIGKILLs the top-level process only (not the full process group)
- Antigravity model switching is applied by mutating `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`; concurrent interactive Agy sessions (if any) would see the same setting
- Discord requires Message Content intent in the Developer Portal for plain-message routing
- Worker jobs depend on local git checkouts and GitHub token access; missing repos fail loudly instead of scanning or modifying the wrong path
- Discord snowflakes must go through the interactive adapter's alias mapping;
  direct `Number(snowflake)` conversion is unsafe for authorization and routing
